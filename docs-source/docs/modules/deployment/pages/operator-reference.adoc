== AkkaMicroservices deployment descriptor (CRD)

The deployment descriptor of an Akka Microservice that is managed by the Akka Operator is defined in a https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[Kubernetes Custom Resource {tab-icon}, window="tab"].

The https://lightbend.github.io/akka-operator-helm/akka-operator/crds/v1/akka-microservices-crd.yml[schema definition of the AkkaMicroservices deployment descriptor (CRD) {tab-icon}, window="tab"].

A fictive example of a https://lightbend.github.io/akka-operator-helm/api-reference/v1/shopping-cart-service-full-cr.yml[deployment descriptor (CR) containing all properties {tab-icon}, window="tab"].

To apply customizations on top of a default deployment descriptor (CR) we suggest to leverage https://kustomize.io[Kustomize] built into `kubectl`.
Prepare a folder called `base` containing the following files:

The default deployment descriptor (CR):
[source,yaml,title='shopping-cart-service.yml']
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  image: <image>
----

A basic reference to it for Kustomize:
[source,yaml,title='kustomization.yml']
----
resources:
- shopping-cart-service.yml
----

You can already deploy you default service by running:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl apply -k base
----

== Scale the number of Pods

The `replicas` field in the deployment descriptor defines the number of Pods that will be used.

Create a separate folder along `base` and call it `replicas` with this content:

The actual customization:
[source,yaml,title='replicas.yml']
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
----

And a reference to the customization:
[source,yaml,title='kustomization.yml']
----
bases:
- ../base
patchesStrategicMerge:
- replicas.yaml
----

You can scale the number of pods by applying the changed deployment descriptor by running:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl apply -k replicas
----

Kubernetes will add or remove Pods to adjust to the desired number.

Another way of changing number of Pods is to use `kubectl scale` without changing the deployment descriptor:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl scale --replicas=3 akkamicroservices shopping-cart-servics
----

== Resource requests and limits

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[Resources for Containers {tab-icon}, window="tab"] can be defined in the Akka Microservices deployment descriptor.

Create a separate folder along `base` and call it `resources` with this content:

The actual customization:
[source,yaml,title='resources.yml']
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  resources:
  limits:
    memory: "2Gi"
  requests:
    memory: "2Gi"
    cpu: "1"
----

And a reference to the customization:
[source,yaml,title='kustomization.yml']
----
bases:
- ../base
patchesStrategicMerge:
- resources.yaml
----

Apply the new resources and limits by running:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl apply -k resources
----

For multi-threaded applications such as the JVM, the CFS scheduler limits are an ill fit, because they will restrict the allowed CPU usage even when more CPU cycles are available from the host system. This means your application may be starved of CPU time, but your system appears idle.

To avoid CFS scheduler limits, it is best not to use `resources.limits.cpu` limits, but use `resources.requests.cpu` configuration instead.

== Namespaces

The Akka Operator manages Akka Microservices in all namespaces of the Kubernetes cluster, which means that you should only install the operator once. It is possible to configure the operator to only manage a specific namespace if that would be needed.

You can define a specific namespace that the operator should manage with the following value of the Helm chart when installing the operator.

[source,shell script]
----
--set java_tool_options="-Dakka.operator.application-namespace=the-app-ns -Xlog:gc -XX:InitialRAMPercentage=75 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75"
----

The operator itself can still be installed in a different namespace, or in the same namespace.
